## 🗞️ Description

Now that you have a portfolio site, your goal for this assignment is to add a **contact form** to your **existing** one-page **personal portfolio** created in your **Week 1 - portfolio assignment**. Ensure you migrate your Week 1 portfolio **source code** for the editable files specified below to this repository, add a contact form to it, and perform some DOM manipulation to display the form data on the webpage after the form is submitted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This week's assignment is not about reinventing the wheel!
> You **don't need to start from scratch** — just **copy over** your existing code from **Week 1** and **refactor** it to improve,
> optimize, or add new features i.e a contact form.

## fields required in the contact form

- first name
- second name
- email
- message

> [!CAUTION]
> Your submission is rendered invalid and you would be given a grade of **zero**
> if you do not implement DOM manipulation
